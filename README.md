<h1>Pyramidal tract neurons and Parkinsonâ€™s disease in simulated mouse primary motor cortex</h1>
<p>Pyramidal tract neurons are the most direct output to muscles from the primary motor cortex (M1). <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/25/5553">Liqiang Chu et al (2021)</a> have shown that layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PT5B) decrease in excitability in parkinsonian as compared with control M1 in mice treated with 6-OHDA.
We built this simulation, based on a <a href="https://github.com/suny-downstate-medical-center/netpyne/tree/development/examples/M1detailed">detailed motor cortex implementation in NetPyNE</a>, to see how the changed PT5B neuron excitability changes M1 spiking dynamics.</p>
<p>NetPyNE is a Python wrapper to the NEURON simulator.</p>
